# Life Sprints

> A DotNet - React web application

Life Sprint web application with Dot-Net backend and React frontend.

I will create a better README and Checklist as I go (hopefully) but just need to get ideas out.

I have ADHD and found a system that kind of helps me get things done.
I call it "life-sprints", based on the Agile-Scrum methodology.
I use the Obsidian markdown editor currently, which is cool.
However, I have an Annual backlog, monthly backlog, and weekly sprint.
Using check-boxes, when I complete a task, I need to check it off on three pages.
I want to create and deploy a web application that has these Check-List powers using C# and the .NET framework for the backend and React on the frontend.
These tools are chosen because they are popular, performant, and I use them at work - so familiarity and practice.
I have a digital Ocean account, so I'll docker-ize the application and deploy there I think at the end.

Ironically using Kanban because I cannot dedicate consistent time each week.
